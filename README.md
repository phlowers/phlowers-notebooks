# Phlowers JupyterLite Demo

## Phlowers in your browser

In order to tests phlowers packages, an in-browser jupyter (aka jupyterlite) is avaible for tutorials purposes

➡️ **https://phlowers.github.io/phlowers-notebooks**

The notebooks are in the ./content folder, organized by theme.  
Data can be found in the  ./data folder.

JupyterLite is also a way to test it on pyodide kernel, because phlowers want to be compatible with in-browser execution provided by pyodide.  
It also avoids to add loads to a jupyter server solution as Binder.  
This Phlowers jupyterlite is a local execution: you can change settings, add your personal notebooks, and also install application.

Be patient during execution, JupyterLite can be slow compared to classic jupyter.

- Firefox 90+
